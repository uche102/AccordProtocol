**M-of-N multisig treasury management on Stellar Soroban — no trusted intermediaries, no single points of failure.**

---

## The Problem

Shared crypto treasuries are hard to manage safely. Most teams resort to one of three bad options:

- **Single-key wallets** — one person controls everything. One compromise = total loss.
- **Centralised services** — custody handed to a third party. You trust them, not code.
- **Complex L1 multisigs** — expensive gas, slow UX, inaccessible to non-technical co-owners.

Accord is a fourth option: a lightweight, fully on-chain multisig built on Stellar Soroban. Every proposal, approval, and execution is recorded on-chain and verifiable by anyone. The contract holds the funds — no one person does.

---

## What Accord Does

Any group of co-owners can deploy Accord and manage a shared treasury with configurable M-of-N approval rules. The full lifecycle — from creating a payment proposal to executing the transfer — happens on-chain and through a clean web interface.

```
Owner A creates a proposal → Owner B & C approve → threshold met → any owner executes
```

**Key properties:**

- **Threshold-based approvals** — set any M-of-N rule (e.g. 2-of-3, 3-of-5)
- **Proposal lifecycle** — `Pending → Ready → Executed | Expired | Revoked`
- **Any Stellar token** — XLM, USDC, EURC, or any SEP-41 compatible token
- **Deadline enforcement** — proposals auto-expire on-chain, no manual cleanup needed
- **Upgradeable contract** — code can be improved without losing state or changing the contract ID
- **Zero trusted intermediaries** — the contract is the only custodian

Read calls use `simulateTransaction` — no wallet needed, no fees. Write calls (approve, execute, create) go through Freighter for signing and are submitted to the network.

## Getting Started

> **New contributors:** See [`docs/SETUP.md`](./docs/SETUP.md) for full environment setup on macOS, Linux, and Windows (WSL2).

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thegreatfeez/accord-protocol.git
cd accord-protocol
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env.local
cd frontend && npm ci
```

### 2. Fill in your `.env.local`

```env
VITE_SOROBAN_RPC_URL=https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org
VITE_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE=Test SDF Network ; September 2015
VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=CD4YAMHZETIO3GTHP4JB3SF2LQFQMZ6MW5FUNCTMXYGOVN6AAXDBQKJS
VITE_SIM_SOURCE=<any funded testnet public key>
```

`VITE_SIM_SOURCE` is just a funded testnet key used to build simulation transactions — it never signs anything. Get a free testnet account at [Friendbot](https://friendbot.stellar.org).

### 3. Run the frontend

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Run the contract tests

```bash
cd contracts/accord && cargo test
# 29 tests, all should pass
```

## Contract Functions

| Function | Who can call | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `initialize(owners, threshold)` | Anyone (once) | Sets up the multisig — owners list and M-of-N threshold |
| `create_proposal(proposer, to, amount, token, description, deadline)` | Owners only | Creates a new transfer proposal |
| `approve(approver, proposal_id)` | Owners only | Adds approval; auto-transitions to `Ready` at threshold |
| `revoke(approver, proposal_id)` | Owners only | Removes approval; transitions back to `Pending` if needed |
| `execute(executor, proposal_id)` | Owners only | Transfers tokens on-chain when proposal is `Ready` |
| `upgrade(caller, new_wasm_hash)` | Owners only | Replaces contract code in-place — state and contract ID preserved |
| `get_proposal(id)` | Anyone | Returns proposal with derived status |
| `get_proposals_paged(offset, limit)` | Anyone | Paginated proposal list |
| `get_owners()` | Anyone | Returns current owner list |
| `get_threshold()` | Anyone | Returns current threshold |
| `is_owner(address)` | Anyone | Checks if an address is an owner |
| `has_approved(proposal_id, owner)` | Anyone | Checks if an owner has approved a specific proposal |

## Roadmap

### Near-term
- [ ] Real-time event feed for proposal activity (on-chain events → UI notifications)
- [ ] Owner management proposals (add/remove owner via the proposal flow)
- [ ] Revoke button in the UI

### Mid-term
- [ ] Multi-token treasury dashboard (aggregate balances for all held tokens)
- [ ] Time-locked execution (enforce a delay after threshold is met)
- [ ] Mobile-responsive UI

### Long-term
- [ ] Per-owner spending limits
- [ ] Proposal categories and tagging
- [ ] Mainnet deployment guide
