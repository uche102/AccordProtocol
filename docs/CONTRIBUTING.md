# Contributing to Accord Protocol

Thank you for contributing! This guide covers the full contributor workflow: environment setup, finding work, opening pull requests, and code standards.

Read the [README](../README.md) and [Architecture](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for product context first.

## Ways to Contribute

| Area | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **Contract** | Proposal lifecycle improvements, owner rotation, spending limits, gas optimizations |
| **Frontend** | Freighter wallet integration, real-time event feed, mobile UI, accessibility |
| **Testing** | Additional contract tests, property-based tests, E2E UI tests |
| **Documentation** | Diagrams, video walkthroughs, API reference improvements |
| **Reviews** | Thoughtful PR reviews with concrete suggestions |
| **Infrastructure** | CI improvements, Dependabot config, deployment scripts |

## Development Setup

See [`docs/SETUP.md`](./SETUP.md) for a step-by-step guide across macOS, Linux, and Windows (WSL2).

---

## Finding Work

1. Check the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/thegreatfeez/accord-protocol/issues) tab for open issues.
2. Issues tagged **`good first issue`** are scoped for new contributors.
3. Issues tagged **`drips-wave`** are eligible for Stellar Drips Wave rewards.
4. Comment on an issue before starting to avoid duplicated effort.
5. Do not start work on an issue that is already assigned or actively being addressed.

---

## Contribution Workflow

1. **Fork** the repository (or clone if you have direct access).
2. **Create a branch** from `main` using the naming conventions below.
3. **Implement** the smallest change that satisfies the issue, with tests.
4. **Run local checks** (see [Testing](#testing)).
5. **Open a pull request** into `main` with a clear title and description.
6. **Respond to review feedback** promptly — maintainers aim to review within 3 business days.

## Branching and Commits

### Branch Naming

| Prefix | Use Case | Example |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `feat/` | New feature | `feat/freighter-wallet` |
| `fix/` | Bug fix | `fix/approval-counter` |
| `contract/` | Contract changes | `contract/proposal-expiry` |
| `docs/` | Documentation | `docs/architecture-diagram` |
| `chore/` | Config, CI, tooling | `chore/dependabot-config` |
| `test/` | Tests only | `test/execute-edge-cases` |

### Commit Messages

- Use imperative mood: `Add`, `Fix`, `Update` — not `Added`, `Fixed`
- Keep the subject line ≤ 72 characters
- Add a blank line + body when explaining a non-obvious "why"

### Pull Request Description

Include:
1. **What** changed (high level)
2. **Why** it was needed — link the issue (`Fixes #N` or `Refs #N`)
3. **How to verify** — commands run, screenshots for UI changes
4. **Risks / follow-ups** — known limitations, deferred work

Use **Draft PRs** for early feedback when the change is not yet polished.

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript / React (`frontend/`)

- Avoid `any` — use explicit types and narrow unions.
- Prefer small, composable components; lift state only as high as needed.
- Use semantic HTML and label all form controls (accessibility).
- Follow existing Tailwind patterns; avoid one-off inline styles.
- Use `BigInt` (not `Number`) for all on-chain token amounts — see [Architecture](./ARCHITECTURE.md#7-token-handling).

### Rust / Soroban (`contracts/`)

- Name storage keys, types, and public functions clearly.
- Document non-obvious invariants in comments near the enforcement point.
- Return typed errors (`ContractError`) — never panic on user-controlled inputs.
- Use `checked_add` / `checked_sub` for all arithmetic; return `ArithmeticError` on overflow.
- Extend TTLs (`bump_instance` / `bump_persistent`) whenever you read from storage.

### General

- Match the style of surrounding code.
- Do not commit private keys, seed phrases, or `.env` files.
- Do not add production-network values (mainnet RPC URLs, mainnet contract IDs) to the codebase.

---

## Testing

Run these checks before opening a PR:

```bash
# Contract
cd contracts/accord
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
cargo test

# Frontend (from repo root)
cd frontend
npm run lint
npm run build
```

All checks must pass (exit 0) before a PR can be merged.

### Adding Contract Tests

- Add tests in `contracts/accord/src/test.rs`.
- Test positive paths (happy flow) AND negative paths (error cases).
- Use `env.mock_all_auths()` for simplicity or `env.mock_auths()` when testing auth specifics.
- Set ledger timestamps explicitly with `env.ledger().set(...)` for deadline-sensitive tests.

### Adding Frontend Tests

The project currently uses manual verification for UI changes. If you add a test runner (`vitest`, `@testing-library/react`), update this section and the CI workflow.

---

## Documentation

- Update `README.md` when setup steps, prerequisites, or architecture changes.
- Update `docs/CONTRACT_API.md` when adding or changing contract functions.
- Update `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for structural changes to data flow or storage layout.
- For small behavior changes, a clear PR description is sufficient.

## Security

Do not open public GitHub issues for unfixed security vulnerabilities.

Use GitHub's private **Security Advisory** flow (Security tab → "Report a vulnerability"). See [`docs/SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md) for full disclosure policy.
